    <summary>Notes and Info</summary>

Today, on March 18, 2024, this repository has undergone a significant update. Every file, except SpotOn itself, has been changed. Moving forward, only the latest version, v3.0.2, will be supported. Consequently, all userscripts are now deprecated. The repository has been transformed from a large collection to a more streamlined view of SpotOn, which can be read in about 10 minutes. Previous resources have been replaced with an image folder. We have fully transitioned to [SpotOnThemes](https://github.com/SenpaiHunters/SpotOnTheme) for all theme repository needs. The previous reports and feature requests have been updated, giving the repository a fresh look. Additionally, some interesting statistics have been added at the top.

**Image**

![SpotOn Image](resources/images/spoton.png)

1.  Türkçe
2.  English
3.  Deutsch
4.  Français
5.  Español
6.  Italiano

**Image two:**
![alt text](resources/images/translate-settings.png)

c. Custom CSS

Here, you can make whatever you want. I suggest turning off SpotOn before editing a theme or making it support SpotOn.

By default, we'll have a few themes you can pick from. These are the defaults. Then you have your controls.

<img src="resources/images/custom-css.png" alt="custom css" width="400">

<img src="resources/images/custom-css-2.png" alt="custom css" width="400">

<img src="resources/images/custom-css-3.png" alt="custom css" width="400">

(Refer to image two.) The `Save & Load Theme` button will do as stated: it will save the current theme and load it into the page without needing to reload. Now, a big note here is that this version of the Custom CSS does not have any sort of syntax highlighting or linting. This is a bare-bones lightweight CSS theme creator. If you need to lint and correct your CSS, you can do it in VSCode or any IDE.

<br>

d. Non-codeable themes
Here, you can change the lyrics color, lyrics font size, or (with SpotOn, which makes this feature actually useful), change the color of the navigation bar (NB), and now playing bar (NPB).

![non codedable themes](resources/images/non-codetheme.png)

e. Hotkeys
SpotOn comes with full customisable hotkeys, Play/Pause and Skip/Reverse with your Media Keys! All changeable at `chrome://extensions/shortcuts`

| Name                     | Hotkey               | Defaults |
| ------------------------ | -------------------- | -------- |
| Activate the extension   | N/A                  | N/A      |
| Hide the Now Playing Bar | ⌃⌘A                  | N/A      |
| Hide the Sidebar         | ⌃⌘S                  | N/A      |
| Like/Dislike             | ⌘⇧B                  | N/A      |
| Next Track               | Media Next Track     | Yes      |
| Open Spotify             | ⌘⇧O                  | N/A      |
| Play/Pause               | Media Play/Pause     | Yes      |
| Previous Track           | Media Previous Track | Yes      |
| Toggle Repeat            | ⌥R                   | N/A      |
| Seek Backward            | N/A                  | N/A      |
| Seek Forward             | N/A                  | N/A      |
| Toggle Shuffle           | ⌥S                   | N/A      |
| Volume Down              | N/A                  | N/A      |
| Toggle Mute              | N/A                  | N/A      |
| Volume Up                | N/A                  | N/A      |

What I mean by "hotkey" are suggested and used hotkeys (those used by me). The only three set by default and cannot be reset (if changed) are the media keys, which can be made global (works outside of the browser) or only inside the browser.

For more information on how to create a custom hotkey, it's pretty simple: click the hotkey box, then on your keyboard, press the combination you want. Let go, and voilà! If there are no conflicts, you'll see that your keybind is ready to use! The keen-eyed among you might have noticed that the list includes macOS keybinds. However, this doesn't matter as Chrome will detect your system and adjust accordingly. (This repository won't; I use a Mac, so there will be Mac keybinds :0)

Honestly, this may seem minimal for now, but that's okay. I plan to enhance it further with each update. Currently, it's the lightest and fastest Spotify enhancer online, aligning with my goals for all extensions. While apps like Spcitify enhance the app directly, mine is based on Chrome extensions. (Maybe an FF version soon?)

## Install Guide

The Chrome extension store lags in releases because Chrome's review process can take up to a month. Changes should go live within a few hours ideally. If you install from the source and seek quicker updates than Chrome's Web Store, go for it!

### Install from Chrome Web Store

1. **Install SpotOn Extension:**

   - Visit [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/spoton/hnbcgkmojpjmncmplcnefjnmcbckadff?hl)
   - Click "Add to Chrome" and review the permissions required.
   - Proceed by clicking "Add Extension."

2. **Get Started with SpotOn:**
   - Load Spotify or open a new tab and modify SpotOn settings as needed.

### Permissions Explained:
When installing SpotOn (from the chrome web store), you'll be prompted to grant certain permissions. Here's why they are necessary:

- **Read and Change Your Data on open.spotify.com**:
  - **Purpose**: This permission allows SpotOn to modify the Spotify Web Player's user interface and functionality to provide the features and customizations that SpotOn offers. It's essential for applying visual themes, toggles, and other enhancements directly within your Spotify experience.
  - **Privacy**: We only modify the client-side presentation and functionality. No modifications are made to the data you send to or receive from Spotify's servers. Your Spotify data remains private and secure.

- **Read Your Browsing History**:
  - **Purpose**: This might sound more invasive than it is. In reality, SpotOn uses this permission to identify when you have Spotify open in your browser so it can apply the necessary enhancements without you having to do anything extra. By enhancements, this can be the use of a hotkey to open Spotify or anything that requires the extension to locate Spotify. It's used to streamline the process of detecting and interacting with Spotify web pages.
  - **Privacy**: SpotOn does not track, store, or transmit your browsing history. The extension operates entirely locally on your computer, and this permission is solely for recognizing Spotify web pages to function correctly. Your browsing history remains private and is not accessed for any other purpose.

SpotOn is committed to full transparency and privacy. Being an open-source project, we invite everyone to explore our codebase to see exactly how it functions and ensures user privacy. We encourage a deeper look into our practices and the mechanics behind SpotOn by visiting our repository. For more insights into our approach to privacy and the principles guiding our development, please check out our [License](/license.md) and [Privacy Policy](Private%20Policy.md).

### Install from Source

1. **Clone the Source Repository:**

   - Clone via terminal: `gh repo clone SenpaiHunters/SpotOn` or `git clone https://github.com/SenpaiHunters/SpotOn.git`
   - Alternatively, download the source as a ZIP file from the repository.

2. **Set Up the Extension in Chrome:**
   - Access `chrome://extensions` in your browser.
   - Enable developer mode (top right toggle).
   - Select "Load Unpacked" and navigate to the `SpotOn/SpotOn` folder.
   - Confirm by pressing `enter` or `return` on your keyboard, and customize SpotOn settings as required.
