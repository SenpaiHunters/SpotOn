# What is SpotOn?


SpotOn is a Spotify redesign that includes a new font, a more prominent sidebar, a hidden Now Playing Bar (scroll to see it), a changeable time to the right of the progress bar (press the time to see it), a blurring backdrop, and much more!


# How to use SpotOn?


SpotOn needs the usage of Spotify Web Player and is not supported by Spotify's app. To be clear, only Spotify Web Player supports it. This is incompatible with the installed app.


# Supported platfroms?


SpotOn is a complete userscript, which means you, the user, may customise anything! The majority of the script is labelled with // (entry), but not all of it. You'll need to Command + F (Find) some of these by typing the name out; I'm currently going over this and adding entries to the script.


Chrome -  ✅
Firefox -  ✅
Orion -  ✅*
Safari - ❌

* = Slower performance than chrome based web browsing; as it uses an open-sourced safari code. (Safari with extensions)

All systems ✅ There are no required system requirements as it’s simply a userscript, however, low-end hardware may face some performance drops or lower than expected speed

# Install 
First read the 'README.md' and 'LICENSE'
