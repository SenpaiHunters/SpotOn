# What is SpotOn?


SpotOn is a complete overhaul of [Spotify Web Player's](https://open.spotify.com/) design that includes a customisable new font, a bolded/more prominent menu bar, a redesigned __hidden__ Now Playing Bar __(scroll down to see it, want to see how it looks, look above)__, a changeable time to the right of the progress bar __(Refer to the above image to see this, to invoke it, simply click it)__, a blurred backdrop, Auto lyric search on Genius, copy track info, ___rainbow controls [Affected buttons - Full screen, lyrics, like song, queue, devices, and volume)___ __(This can be turned off simply by removing the command line)__ a hidden Spotify Logo __(Can be turned back on)__, hidden 'install' app, hidden podcasts, removal of the bottom content bar (which hosts the social links of Spotify). capitalisation of the first letter _(can turn off by removing ___first-letter {", "    text-transform: uppercase !important;}",___. But try it before you remove it, you might like it!)_, misc performance fixes, increased site wide readability, and so much more! 



# How do i use SpotOn?


SpotOn needs the usage of [Spotify Web Player's](https://open.spotify.com/) and is not supported by Spotify's app. To be clear, only Spotify Web Player supports it. This is incompatible with the installed app. If i get enough popularity i may look into a way of porting it to the app. But, that's very
unlikely, and very time consuming. 


# How do i enable V 0.4 - 'No Spotify Lyrics? Then Let's Check Genius!'


### To enable it, simply follow this Step-By-Step guide!
1. Click on Tampermonkey (or any userscript)



![Click on Tampermonkey](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103985728/195988967-4ed93961-7b84-4b0c-9938-a2aba8b075f8.png)


2. Click on "No Spotify Lyrics? Then Lets Check Genius! Show Lyrics"


![SCR-20221016-l5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103985728/195988969-c1b47c85-86b1-40ac-8253-f1bb183f2e5d.png)



3. It'll automatically load in, with the current playing song with the lyrics if Genius has it.
      - If it's not auto loaded (1 sec of time) to the next lyrics press 'Wrong Lyrics'
      - It'll bring you back to the search, if neither Genius nor Spotify has the lyrics it'll say "Lyrics not found'

4. To hide the sidebar, either reload, or press 'hide'. 
    - If you reloaded repeat steps 1 & 2 to reenable it.

5.  If you press 'Hide' you'll see a little Genius Button cleanly off to the right
     - If you reloaded repeat steps 1 & 2 for the button to come back.

# SpotOn's supported platforms?


SpotOn is a complete **userscript/javascript**, which means you, the user, may _customise_ anything! The majority of the script is labelled with __// (entry)__ or __"*/*/"__ but not all of it. Sometimes you'll need to find it __(Command + F)__ by typing the name out; I'm currently going over this and adding entries to the script, some are not needed as they are not changeable, but what can be modified will have an entry.


### Chrome -  ✅


### Firefox -  ✅


### Orion -  ✅
 - Slower performance than expected in testing


### Safari - ✅


### Microsoft Edge - ✅


### Opera - ✅



### ✅ = Supportation of __Windows + Mac__ , there are no required system requirements as it’s simply a userscript/javascript, however, low-end hardware may face some performance drops or lower than expected speed


# Supported Script-Managers


- ### Firefox: Greasemonkey, Tampermonkey, or Violentmonkey
- ### Safari: Tampermonkey or Userscripts
- ### Microsoft Edge: Tampermonkey
- ### Opera: Tampermonkey or Violentmonkey
- ### AdGuard: (no additional software required)

# Install


### For our install guide, it'll be using TamperMoneky! But, it should be the same for all scriot managers.
1. Install [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/), [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/get-it/) or [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/)
2. Copy the [Code V 0.4](https://github.com/SenpaiHunters/SpotOn/blob/Main/Code%20V4) contents
3. Load the settings of Tampermoneky
   - First by clicking on the extention
   - Click 'Dashboard'
4. You'll first load into 'Installed-Scripts'
5. You then want to click the little plus icon
6. With the contents of [Code V 0.4](https://github.com/SenpaiHunters/SpotOn/blob/Main/Code%20V4)
7. You'll want to press ___Command+A___ to select everything, and then press ___Command+V___ to paste
8. Hit ___Command+S___ to save
9. You have now successfully installed SpotOn!
  - __(Note)__ For windows the keybind is ___Cntrl___ instead of ___Command___
  
  
# Notice
It is recommended you install [Spotify Dynamic Theme Plus extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/spotify-dynamic-theme-plu/bhonlncoengmlbidemffnajjlaijkemm) for the background, and now playing bar to function correctly. The Dynamic Theme is also required for the Now Playing Bar to auto-hide. If it isn’t installed, the bar will load at the top by __default__. _(This can be changed in settings, as the script is fully user customisable! - look for ‘//  main now playing bar’)._
