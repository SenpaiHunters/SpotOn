# What's new!?


### No need for a extra download!


This release is **BIG!** There no longer is a need to download an extra extension for the background to work! This by default is now the cover art of the song blurred! This includes a dynamic background with transparency and __animations__ for Spotify, this changes background to the song/album cover that's playing also adds many __effects and transitions__.


### Dark background

# A new mode!!!


In this new mode, the now playing bar at the bottom no longer is hidden!

### Genius integration now auto searches for the song when going to the next song.
  - __NOTE__ Having this open will reduce song loading speed if you have a lot going on in the background
  - To enable this, simply press the 'Hide Lyrics' then reopen the lyrics by pressing the 'G' on the top right. (Pic for ref)

# Bug fixes
- Ironing out Genius integration with Spotify + Fonts. As well as 'Options'. 
- Menu bar and now playing bar has increased readability.
- Text is easier to read.
- Copying links are now faster
- Fixed several padding issues
- New colour on highlight!



# Some things to note
With the release of V0.5, users on low-end software might encounter a slight performance drop. But! I've tested it on the lowest of hardware and it's not really noticeable, unless you reload the Spotify page every single second, sometimes the images won't change, and for that to fix itself simply skip the song back and forwards.


# Addition of light weight SpotOn 
This has got many features, but is intended for low performance hardware. The performance difference between the 3 different 'SpotOn's are about 0.43% Performance gain.  So, it won't be getting looked at, nor will have any good features.

# How to use the Spotify Web Player

<details><summary>For the info, click me!</summary>
<p> 
      
      If you want to reduce the number of apps you've installed on your PC, using the Spotify Web Player
      on your browser is a convenient solution. You'll notice very few differences between the web player and the app. 
      And if you enjoy streaming free music online, the web player works even if you have a free Spotify account.
      
      The Spotify Web Player is supported by Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Opera.
      
      Access the Spotify Web Player
      To access the Spotify Web Player, launch your favorite Internet browser and follow these steps:
      - Go to the Spotify Browse page.
      - Select Log In.
      - If you don't have a Spotify account, select Sign Up and create an account using either an email or Facebook account.
      - Enter your username and password and select Login. Or, select Log In With Facebook.
      
      
      Spotify Web Player Home
      Once you've logged into Spotify's Web Player you'll
      see that it's a simple layout. The left pane lists your available options with the first four
      being ones that you'll use the most. These are Search, Home, Your Library, and Recently Played.
      
      
      The Home page gives a broad look at all of the main options. Here you'll find:
      Quick links at the top to Featured, Podcasts, Charts, Genres, New Releases, and Discover.
      Suggested music based on your listening history.
      Your recently played music.
      "More Like" sections with specific artists related to your music tastes.
      Themed suggestions based on the day of the week or special holidays.
      Top music lists.
      The Home page is customized based on your listening behavior, so you may see more or fewer options than listed above.
      
      
      Spotify Search
      If you know what you're looking for then choose this option. 
      Once you do this, a text box displays at the top of the screen. Enter your search
      phrase to find the music you want. 
      This can be an artist's name, the title of a song or album, a playlist, or even a music genre. Once you start
      typing, a list of results displays. 
      Select a result from the list to start listening. 
      The results page is categorized into useful sections 
      such as Artists, Albums, Playlists, Podcasts, Episodes, and more.
      
      
      Your Spotify Library
      The Your Library section of the Spotify Web Player displays an overview of all
      of the music you've listened to or saved. These are organized into
      Playlists, Songs, Albums, Artists, and Podcasts, with quick links at the top. 
      If you want to customize your own playlist, select New Playlist in the
      upper right corner of the screen. Spotify recommends music based on your playlist title.
      Add music in the Create Playlist screen, or just add music
      as you browse Spotify and listen to music.

      Discover New Music
      Spotify is also a music recommendation service, and this option provides a great way to discover new music.

      The results you see are suggestions that Spotify thinks you might like.
      These are based on various factors including the type of music you've been listening to. 
      Tracks are also listed if they are currently popular and fit into the genres of music you listen to.


      Stream Music With Spotify Web Player
      There are a lot of features tucked deep into the web app. These are almost identical to the desktop app. 
      To find these, just look for the More menu (the three dot icons) beside playlists or individual tracks.



      Start Radio: Launches a special Spotify Web Player 
      feature and plays songs related to the artist, playlist, or song you launched it from.
      Save to Your Library: Stores the song in your library for easy access later.
      Add to Queue: Lines up individual tracks in the order you want to listen to them.
      Add to Playlist: Quickly saves tracks to any of your playlists.
      Copy Song Link: Shares the track to friends on social media or in an email.
      Play Music Using the Spotify Web Player Hotkeys
      One thing you may miss when you switch to the Spotify Web Player is that many 
      keyboard hotkeys that worked in the desktop app won't work in the web
      player. However, by installing the Spotify Web Player Hotkeys extension, 
      you can still control song play with your keyboard with the following controls.


      Chrome Spotify Web Player Hotkey:

      
      Pause or Play: Alt+Shift+P

      
      Play Next Track: Alt+Shift+.

      
      Play Previous Track: Alt+Shift+,

      
      Save Track: Alt+Shift+F

      
      
      Firefox Spotify Hotkeys:

      
      Pause or Play: Alt+Shift+P

      
      Play Next Track: Alt+Shift+.

      
      Play Previous Track: Alt+Shift+,

      
      Shuffle: Alt+Shift+F

      
      Repeat: Alt+Shift+R

      
      Play Album: Alt+Shift+B
      
      
      
      Other Benefits of the Spotify Web Player
      If you aren't convinced yet that streaming music with the Spotify Web Player doesn't 
      detract from your music listening experience, consider all of
      the extra benefits that this offers.
      
      Save PC resources: The desktop Spotify client launches on start-up and uses system resources. 
      Avoid the clutter and CPU usage by uninstalling the
      desktop client and using the web player instead.
      Listening to music should be a hassle-free experience. 
      With the features that the Spotify Web Player offers, there's really no reason to use the
      desktop client.

# How do I use SpotOn?


SpotOn needs the usage of [Spotify Web Player's](https://open.spotify.com/) and is not supported by Spotify's app. To be clear, only [Spotify Web Player's](https://open.spotify.com/) supports it. This is incompatible with the installed app. If i get enough popularity i may look into a way of porting it to the app. But, that's very
unlikely, and very time consuming.

# SpotOn's supported platforms?


SpotOn is a complete **userscript/javascript**, which means you, the user, may _customise_ anything! The majority of the script is labelled with __// (entry)__ or __"*/*/"__ but not all of it. Sometimes you'll need to find it __(Command + F)__ by typing the name out; I'm currently going over this and adding entries to the script, some are not needed as they are not changeable, but what can be modified will have an entry.


### Chrome -  ✅


### Firefox -  ✅


### Orion -  ✅
 - Slower performance than expected in testing


### Safari - ✅


### Microsoft Edge - ✅


### Opera - ✅



### ✅ = Supportation of __Windows + Mac__ , there are no required system requirements as it’s simply a userscript/javascript, however, low-end hardware may face some performance drops or lower than expected speed
