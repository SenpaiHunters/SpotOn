# Install Instructions

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103985728/236811226-3070dfb3-85e9-4195-922e-40ab8a4bdf35.mp4





# Browser Support


### Arc
Arc is Chromium on crack, it's so nice, MacOS exclusive (windows later this year), and this is my main browser will be providing images from this website!

### Firefox
Supported, although I main chromium, I'll need to figure out a way to make a extension for Firefox.

### Chrome
Of course, Chrome will still be fully supported

### Safari
This is spotty, however, currently, Safari is unsupported (sorry, will look into it)

(It's only supported via a userscript, sorry! you'll be behind features)

### Orion
Same as Safari (as it's WebOS, but it can have extensions!). WOO, supported, same method for install, just using (command + ,) for settings.

### Oprea GX
Supported, it's Chromium...

### Brave
Supported...




# Full feature list
     - More information will be added to the drop-down menu, as well as tagged photos, as you go further.


***





### This page has the full SpotOn features list + Images.
More will be added as they become available, and this page will be updated accordingly.
There are no formal update times, I hope every month or so, but I've run out of things that work with Spotify, however I'm continuously experimenting with new stuff! Nonetheless, bug patches will be supplied when a bug is discovered; I am a lone developer, so please excuse the slow rates!



- Animations!
  - An animation when hovering over a song
  - Added some fun spinning albums 
    - All TOP album covers spin when loading into a playlist(s). 
  - Skip/Reverse animations (Play/Previous as Spotify says)
  - Play/Pause animations
  - Hover animation
  - Playlist (batch) hover animation
  - Album art (hover - library) animation
  - Quick search popup animation
  - And a few more for you to find!
- A new font (Akronim)
  - It may seem different in other browsers (images taken from a Chromium browser) - You may use anything you like! Just make it work on Spotify... It took me some time to find one.
- An updated Nav Bar (NB)
  - This is now pushed out from the whole menu, rounded, and has the album image within (while retaining it inside of the Now Playing Bar (NPB)) (Dimensions are 7.5px across both sides), added a pink haze (rgba(255,192,203,0.1)) for enhanced readability and it to be more pretty, matches dark and white pretty well (rather than solid black thre previously was), rainbow controls (Home, Search, Your Library, Liked Songs Icons, and the drop-down-menu icon for folders), added hover animations, and convenient hotkey access, also added a `hide Nav Bar` bar.
- Overhauled Now Playing Bar (NPB)
  - The modifications are as follows: size is variable depending on display size (bigger display = bigger bar), rounded corners, added a black haze, full rainbow controls, smaller and rounded album art, reduced overall size of the NPB, removed the background on the `.playback-bar`, looks pretty now, `connect to a device` is now also updated.
- Hide the Nav Bar!
  - As said above in the `Nav Bar` section, hiding the nav bar, how? Well, it's very simple, just move your cursor to the edge of the Nav Bar and click the line that pops up, this will hide it, to unhide it follow the same process (Its recommended you go to the top or bottom of the Nav Bar, the middle support seems spotty (see what I did there?) on some browsers).
- Song timings
  - To utilise it, simply click the song time; you'll then see the whole song time OR the remaining time. (Neither will be displayed at the same time.)
    - (I prefer to show the remaining time if you are wondering)
- A dynamic theme, which responds to your cover art and then displays it as the background!
  - This corresponds to the album art; whatever is presented will be blurred and mirrored everywhere!
  - This includes the 'Profile' drop-down, the Right-Click Menu, Hotkeys, and pretty much everything!
  - Fades while skipping - the default of 50px blur (can be increased or decreased, just follow the provided steps)
- Rounded album art covers
  - All album art covers are now 15px rounded!
  - This covers ALL song cover artworks and album cover art, in other words, EVERYTHING.
- Rounded song hover & the now playing song.
- Auto lyric search on Genius 
  - Press the `G` icon on the top right to function the script.
  - *Guide below*
- Copy track info
  - Select `Copy` when you right-click on a song. 
- Rainbow controls 
  - Affected buttons - Full screen, lyrics, like song, queue, devices, volume, PiP, repeat, and shuffle, if the song is liked or not, right side '...' menu, home, search, my library, dropdown menus, & audio icon on playlists. (Maybe more to come?)
   - 'Liked Songs' love heart now glows to match the bottom controls
    - Added a new line to make all icons in the Now Playing Bar to be rainbow can be helpful when installing another extension alongside SpotOn (Whatever that may be)
- When you hover over something, it now has an animation, is underlined, bolded, and turns a rainbow colour!
  - This corresponds to the rainbow controls mentioned above.
- Removed the Spotify Logo
- Removed 'Install' app 
  - Above album art cover -- In Nav Bar
- Removed podcasts -- Can still be found in 'Your Library'
- Removed 'Upgrade' button in top menu -- Can be found under profile still.
  - This mostly affects non-premium users.
- Removal of the bottom content bar 
  - Which hosts the social links of Spotify
  - And just random unneeded things
- Removed which device Spotify is streaming too
  - Only the bottom bar, as it was unneeded, and had bad visitability.
    - If requested I'll put it back in.  
- The initial letter will be capitalised.
- What I mean is that instead of "i wish [...] without," it will now be "I wish [...] Without" in the lyrics.
- All songs/albums/lyrics first letter will be capitalised, once you get used to it, it's very nice.
- Misc performance and bugs fixes
  - Skip speeds, shuffle, and repeat have less latency and hotkey access is quicker.
  - Quicker loading times and search times (with SpotOn accessed)
- Increased site-wide readability
  - Particularly on lyrics and larger content such as "Liked Songs" or "Lyrics."
- Lyrics
  - Simply by adding a nice black border around the elements.
  - Now, the lyrics will be the appropriate size and fit what is being displayed. Smaller words will take up less screen space, while larger lyrics will fill entire the page. Enjoy ❤️ 
  - Lyrics may now be copied (or highlight them — you could not copy lyrics before V 0.5 and below)
- Addition of Hotkeys 
  - (Press 'Shift + ?' or '⌘ + ?' to invoke) 
  - Please see the photos below for a list of Hotkeys. (Alternatively, use the aforementioned Hotkey to get a list)
  - It's clever; it'll figure out what system you're using and display Hotkeys accordingly.
    - This means that on a Mac, 'command' will appear instead of 'windows,' and vice versa.

# Note
Remember, if anything it too much you can always remove it, rainbow controls are not your fancy? Remove them, dislike rounded albums? remove that too. It's all up to you, if you wish for help on removing something feel free to reach out!!

# Spotify wide Hotkeys!

### Keys on Mac VS. Windows

### `⌥ (Option) - (Windows Ctrl)`

### `⌘ (Command) - ( Windows Alt)`

# Genius integration
##### Note for Genius to work, you might need to add/have an active Genius account. 
- Credit to [Cuzi](https://openuserjs.org/scripts/cuzi/Spotify_Genius_Lyrics) original code adapted from him.

### How do I enable 'No Spotify Lyrics? Then Let's Check Genius!'


### To enable it, simply follow this Step-By-Step guide!
1. Click on Tampermonkey (or any userscript)



![Click on Tampermonkey](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103985728/195988967-4ed93961-7b84-4b0c-9938-a2aba8b075f8.png)


2. Click on "No Spotify Lyrics? Then Lets Check Genius! Show Lyrics"


![SCR-20221016-l5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103985728/195988969-c1b47c85-86b1-40ac-8253-f1bb183f2e5d.png)



3. It'll automatically load in, with the current playing song with the lyrics if Genius has it.
      - If it's not auto loaded (1 sec of time) to the next lyrics press 'Wrong Lyrics'
      - It'll bring you back to the search, if neither Genius nor Spotify has the lyrics it'll say "Lyrics not found'
    - Genius integration now auto searches for the song when going to the next song, updated in V 0.5.
     - __NOTE__ Having this open will reduce song loading speed if you have a lot going on in the background
     - To enable this, simply press the 'Hide Lyrics' then reopen the lyrics by pressing the 'G' on the top right. (Pic for ref)


### Picture for reference.

### Lyrics shown to the right of the page

4. To hide the sidebar, either reload, or press 'hide'. 
    - If you reloaded repeat steps 1 & 2 to reenable it.

5.  If you press 'Hide' you'll see a little Genius Button cleanly off to the right
     - If you reloaded repeat steps 1 & 2 for the button to come back.


<img width="122" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103985728/221405927-d81eba89-2b07-48aa-a393-cba34a0ab2a1.png">
