# Quick rundown. 

SpotOn is a Userscript. Userscripts (a.k.a User Scripts, User scripts, or .user.js) are open-source licensed add-ons for web browsers, written in [JavaScript](https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript), that change web pages as they are loaded. They give users the power to make websites do what they want them to, rather than what was originally intended. In our case, we made SpotOn, giving users a new and modern revamp of Spotify, without loss of performance.
