### Keys on Mac VS. Windows

### `⌥ (Option) - (Windows Ctrl)`

# What is SpotOn?


SpotOn is a complete overhaul of [Spotify Web Player's](https://open.spotify.com/) design that includes a customisable new font, a bolded/more prominent menu bar, a redesigned __hidden__ Now Playing Bar __(scroll down to see it, want to see how it looks, look above)__, a changeable time to the right of the progress bar __(Refer to the above image to see this, to invoke it, simply click it)__, a blurred backdrop, Auto lyric search on Genius, copy track info, ___rainbow controls [Affected buttons - Full screen, lyrics, like song, queue, devices, and volume)___ __(This can be turned off simply by removing the command line)__ a hidden Spotify Logo __(Can be turned back on)__, hidden 'install' app, hidden podcasts, removal of the bottom content bar (which hosts the social links of Spotify). capitalisation of the first letter _(can turn off by removing ___first-letter {", "    text-transform: uppercase !important;}",___. But try it before you remove it, you might like it!)_, misc performance fixes, increased site wide readability, and so much more! 









# How do I use SpotOn?


SpotOn needs the usage of [Spotify Web Player's](https://open.spotify.com/) and is not supported by Spotify's app. To be clear, only [Spotify Web Player's](https://open.spotify.com/) supports it. This is incompatible with the installed app. If i get enough popularity i may look into a way of porting it to the app. But, that's very
unlikely, and very time consuming. 


# SpotOn's supported platforms?


SpotOn is a complete **userscript/javascript**, which means you, the user, may _customise_ anything! The majority of the script is labelled with __// (entry)__ or __"*/*/"__ but not all of it. Sometimes you'll need to find it __(Command + F)__ by typing the name out; I'm currently going over this and adding entries to the script, some are not needed as they are not changeable, but what can be modified will have an entry.


### Chrome -  ✅


### Firefox -  ✅


### Orion -  ✅
 - Slower performance than expected in testing


### Safari - ✅


### Microsoft Edge - ✅


### Opera - ✅



### ✅ = Supportation of __Windows + Mac__ , there are no required system requirements as it’s simply a userscript/javascript, however, low-end hardware may face some performance drops or lower than expected speed

# Addition of SpotOn Lightweight
This has not many features, but is intended for low performance hardware. The performance difference between the 3 different SpotOn's are about 0.43% Performance gain.  So, it won't be getting looked at, nor will have any good features.
