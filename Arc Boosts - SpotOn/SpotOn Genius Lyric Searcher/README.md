# Woah, Lyric search when Spotify doesn't have it!

This requires a Userscript, and cannot be transferred to an extension like some others apart of the SpotOn library. 

SpotOn Genius Lyric Searcher is intended to be used with SpotOn, but can be used standalone.


NOTE: You are required to be logged into Genius/have an account, some features inside Genius intergration requires an account, like lyric submittal etc.


# Install Instructions
1. Open the `content.js` file in this repository.
2. Copy the contents (or press the 2nd icon for a faster way)
3. Paste into a Userscript managner (like Tampermonkey) 
4. You're off to the races!

# To enable
It should be enabled by default, but if it isn't go into your userscript manager and click `show lyrics`
