This is for Arc browser users, you can use this as a normal user you'll just need to create a `manifest.json` and link the `content.js` sheet it to.

Arc users! Read directions inside the `content.js`, if you need help feel free to ask!

This will require you to make a boost, so do that and than copy the contents inside of the `.js` file you've made.
