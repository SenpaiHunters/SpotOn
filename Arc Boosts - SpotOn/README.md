# Arc Boost Limitations:
In this folder I will host both the `.css` and the `.js` to make SpotOn run!

However, this will not all for any other functions, only a UI overhaul, you will not get the `genius lyric search`, the `copy track info` or anything else, only a UI change

If you wish for the full functions, please copy and paste the `SpotOn V0.7.js` into a Userscript manager.

# If you require help feel free reach out
I currently have SpotOn in arcboosts.com. when it gets published i will update this `README.md` to show that.
However, the code isn't all there as that site limits you to 40000 characters, not at all enough for any of the `.js` barely enough for the `.css`. So, if you are coming from arcboosts.com, please copy the respected files and paste them into your spaces!

# Install Guide
- From the Arc sidebar, click "New Boost" or visit arc://boost/new from your browser address bar.
- Select a template. For style only, select "Style". For JS, select "Replace" or "Inject". You can still change or add more later.
- In the next screen, select "A specific website" or "All websites" depending on the Arc Boost type. If you choose "A specific website", enter the URL.
- In the editor screen, you can replace the contents with the contents of the boost.Arc Boost Editor
1. If there are more file types than one, you can add new file types by clicking "+"
2. You can see the selected file types as indicated above. e.g style.css
3. You can update the settings for the boost by clicking the setting gear

I will release a video on it soon.
