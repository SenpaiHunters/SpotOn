# SpotOn's Extensions
I have moved away from Userscripts to an extension, this allows me to put out WAY more content for SpotOn, as you might see by all the SpotOn (extension name), I'm not rich, so these *WILL NOT* be uploaded to Chrome's Web Store, unless I somehow gain so much popularity someone wants it uploaded. Idk, not anytime soon! (It's ¥679 (5usd), for something I'm not sure a lot of users use, I'd rather use that money somewhere else.)

This allows me to make a nice `popup.html` and improve my skills, as I kinda dislike userscripts lol. Only issue is as I add more I have to edit that everytime!!!! (the `popup.html` i mean)

# SpotOn's for days!
We have
- SpotOn, our original enchancement!
- SpotOn Extended Search, allowing you to specifity your search and even search inside the Spotify app!
- SpotOn Genius Lyric Searcher, sadly this is still a userscript, but I'll contiune to improve it. Allows you to search for Lyrics to a song on Genius.com
- SpotOn Genius Song Replacer, replace the use of Apple Music on Genius.com and instead use Spotify's player
- SpotOn Hotkeys, use media keys to skip/play/pause/reverse, to remap them!
- SpotOn MenubarToggle, userscript, allows you to toggle the Nav Bar and hide it, allowing for more space
- SpotOn MiniPlayer, open a miniplayer, skip/play/pause/reverse/loop/repeat, display album art and more, right click and open your Spotify tab anywhere!
- SpotOn Queue Expander, expands the queue further!
- SpotOn SongCopy, userscript, copy the artist and song name
- SpotOn Speeder, change the speed of the playing song
- and more to come!!! (That's already 10!)
