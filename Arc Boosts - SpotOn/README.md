# SpotOn's Extensions
I have moved away from Userscripts to an extend, this allows me to put out WAY more content for SpotOn, as you might see by all the SpotOn (extension name), I'm not rich, so these WILL NOT be uploaded to Chrome's Web Store, unless I somehow gain so much popularity someone wants it uploaded. Idk, not anytime soon!

This allows me to make a nice `popup.html` and improve my skills, as I kinda dislike userscripts lol. Only issue is as i add more I have to edit that everytime!!!!

# SpotOn's for days!
We have
- SpotOn, our original enchancement!
- SpotOn Extended Search, allowing you to specifity your search and even search inside the Spotify app!
- SpotOn Genius Lyric Searcher, sadly this is still a userscript, but I'll contiune to improve it. Allows you to search for Lyrics to a song on Genius.com
- SpotOn Hotkeys, use media keys to skip/play/pause/reverse, to remap them!
- SpotOn MenubarToggle, userscript, allows you to toggle the Nav Bar and hide it, allowing for more space
- SpotOn MiniPlayer, open a miniplayer, skip/play/pause/reverse/loop/repeat, display album art and more, right click and open your Spotify tab anywhere!
- SpotOn Queue Expander, expands the queue further!
