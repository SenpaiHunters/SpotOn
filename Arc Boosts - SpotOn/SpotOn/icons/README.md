# Icons

By default, we have an Icon/logo. But if you've installed this as an `Arc Boost` then here is how!


# To add an Icon
```
"default_icon": {
        "64": "icons/icon64.png"
    },
```
Into your `manifest.json` with this you can also add:
```
"default_icon": {
      "16": "images/icon16.png",
      "32": "images/icon32.png",
      "48": "images/icon48.png",
      "128": "images/icon128.png"
```
If you want more than 1 icon to use, I use all of them but in this /icons I'll just upload the `icon64.png`

You'll need to add the file `/icons` into your extenstion, just like we did in `/fonts`
