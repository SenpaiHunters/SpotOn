# What is it?

A more powerful way to search Spotify.

You can search by Song, Artist, Album, Release Year, Genre, or any combination of those.

Unlike other SpotOn extensions inside the SpotOn library, this one is standalone! Meaning, you don't need SpotOn for it to work. 

There are 2 search options unlike all SpotOn extensions, this one can search inside the `Spotify.app` too!
