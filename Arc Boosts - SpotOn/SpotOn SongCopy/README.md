# Gimmie Song

This requires a Userscript, and cannot be transferred to an extension like some others apart of the SpotOn library. 

SpotOn SongCopy is intended to be used with SpotOn, but can be used standalone.




# Install Instructions
1. Open the `userscript.js` file in this repository.
2. Copy the contents (or press the 2nd icon for a faster way)
3. Paste into a Userscript managner (like Tampermonkey) 
4. You're off to the races!

# To enable
It is enabled always!

# Load times?
I've got to say, decently fast... (It runs in the background, not effecting page loading timings)
