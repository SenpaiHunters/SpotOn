# Hotkeys!
Basically, adds Hotkeys for gloable use! Oh, and media keys can be used!

I have a Mac, and not being able to use my media keys **SUCKED!**


By default, all media keys work out the box, that means function keys, F8/F9/F10 (media keys for Mac) just work, they can be customised at arc://extensions/shortcuts!

(If you are not using Arc, please go to chrome://extensions/shortcuts)

# Preview!
(Note, by default Like: toggle song like & Playback: toggle repeat none / track / playlist are not set)
