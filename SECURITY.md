## Your Safety is Our Priority

For SpotOn, we prioritize the security and safety of our users above everything else. While it's an ongoing challenge to stay ahead of potential vulnerabilities, we are committed to providing a secure and robust platform.

**Important:** Version 0.1 has been found to contain a critical error that could potentially cause the software to malfunction. We strongly advise all users to upgrade to a supported version (v0.2 or higher) to avoid any security risks.
