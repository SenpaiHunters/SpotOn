We take security vulnerabilities seriously and appreciate your help in identifying and reporting them. If you discover a vulnerability or any potential security issue, please follow these steps:

1. Create a new issue in our repository or make a post in our discussions section.
2. Provide a clear and detailed description of the vulnerability, including steps to reproduce it if possible.
3. If applicable, attach any relevant screenshots or code snippets to help us better understand the issue.
4. We will acknowledge your submission and investigate the reported vulnerability.
5. If additional information is required, we will reach out to you for further details.
6. Once the vulnerability has been addressed, we will release a security patch or update.

We kindly request that you do not publicly disclose the vulnerability until it has been resolved to prevent potential exploitation.

## Your Safety is Our Priority

We prioritize the security and safety of our users. While no software is entirely free from vulnerabilities, we continuously strive to maintain a robust and secure system.

Please note that version 0.1 has failed our internal security checks and contains a critical error that may cause the software to malfunction. We strongly urge all users to update to a supported version (v0.9 or higher) to avoid any potential issues.

Thank you for your cooperation in helping us maintain a secure environment.
